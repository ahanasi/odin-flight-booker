# Odin Flight Booker

Checkout the app [here](https://odin-flights.herokuapp.com/)!

The Odin Flight Booker enables users to book one-way flights using a simple, three-step checkout process. Users must first choose the date, the number of tickets, and optionally, the origin and destination for their trip to search for available flights. They can then choose to select a flight of their choice from the search results generated. The final step would be for users to input passenger details (name & email) into the booking form before booking confirmation.

This project was created as part of the [Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/building-advanced-forms). The main aim while creating this app was to tackle advanced form creation in Rails, particularly nested submissions.
