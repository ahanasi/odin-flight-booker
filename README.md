# Odin Flight Booker


The Odin Flight Booker enables users to book one-way flights using a simple, three-step checkout process.

This project was created as part of the [Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/building-advanced-forms). The main aim while creating this app was to tackle advanced form creation in Rails, particularly nested submissions.
