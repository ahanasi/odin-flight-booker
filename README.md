# Odin Flight Booker


The Odin Flight Booker enables users to book one-way flights using a simple, three-step checkout process.

This project was created as part of the Odin Project's curriculum. The main aim while creating this app was to tackle advanced form creation in Rails, particularly nested submissions.
